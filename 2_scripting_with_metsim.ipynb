    "# Scripting with MetSim\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a tutorial for running MetSim in a scripting environment. \n",
    "The scripting environment allows for a more interactive workflow that will make it easier to manipulate the data that MetSim generates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we will begin to expand on this to show how MetSim can be used programmatically to generate multiple sets of meteorologic data.\n",
    "We will run multiple longwave radiation parameterizations and compare their relative qualities.\n",
    "Finally, we will look at how changing some of the various parameters which MetSim exposes affect the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we begin with some standard imports. For this portion of the tutorial we will be making use of several libraries for analysis and plotting:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `xarray` is used under the hood for managing the output from MetSim\n",
    " - `pandas` is used for setting up the dates for our MetSim run\n",
    " - `holoviews` and `geoviews` will be used for some interactive plotting\n",
    " - `geopandas` is used for used for managing the shapefiles, also used for plotting\n",
    " - `cartopy` is also used for managing the shapefiles, also used for plotting\n",
    " - `metsim`, obviously, will be used for data processing\n",
    "\n",
    "We initialize the notebook by importing these, as well as the `pylab` cell magic, which imports `numpy` and `matplotlib`. \n",
    "We also set up `holoviews` to use the `bokeh` interactive plotting library as the backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there may be some warnings from various Python libraries throughout this tutorial which are not issues as of the presentation date."

    "For this example we will be showing how MetSim can be used on unstructured mesh arrangements as well as the structured latitude-longitude grid that we ran in the command line examples.\n",
    "We will use a setup which consists of twelve \"hydrologic response units\" or HRU.\n",
    "A HRU typically delineates a watershed by topography, soil type, land use, or other defining feature.\n",
    "The HRU delineation we are using comes from the USGS hydrologic unit codes (HUC), with 12 digit codes. \n",
    "Commonly this is referred to as HUC12, which is the finest resolution.\n",
    "Coarser resolutions are available as HUC10 and HUC8.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 12 HRU that we will be running are located along the Green river, just southeast of Seattle. \n",
    "It originates on the western slopes of the Cascade mountains.\n",
    "The upper portion of the Green river provides much of the water for the city of Tacoma, which is south of Seattle.\n",
    "The Green river ultimately ends up as a tributary to the Duwamish river, which flows through Seattle and into Puget Sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look. \n",
    "Because this is an unstructured mesh we will be defining the mesh elements by their respective HUC12 identifiers. \n",
    "We can draw boundaries using a shapefile, which we have obtained from the USGS datasets and included in the tutorial data.\n",
    "There are several tools for plotting maps in Python using shapefiles, most notably Cartopy, GeoPandas, and GeoViews.\n",
    "Other tools for more general GIS functionality include GDAL, Rasterio, Shapely, and Fiona.\n",
    "We will be using Cartopy and GeoPandas to define the geometries and then a combination of GeoViews and HoloViews to actually draw the plots."

    "The information that this dictionary, which we will call `params`, is similar to that which is found in the configuration file.\n",
    "However, there are some notable differences which we will walk through.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, note that we must provide dates as `datetime` objects. \n",
    "This is easily handled via `pandas`. \n",
    "Second, we point out a new parameter, the `scheduler`; we have set it to `threading` for a specific purpose.\n",
    "As mentioned in the command line portion of the tutorial, the scheduler is how MetSim manages jobs under the hood.\n",
    "The default value is the `distributed` scheduler, which does not currently support running in this sort of interactive environment.\n",
    "By setting `scheduler` to `threading` we are able to work in this environment.\n",
    "A notable drawback to this, is that parallelism is significantly hindered. \n",
